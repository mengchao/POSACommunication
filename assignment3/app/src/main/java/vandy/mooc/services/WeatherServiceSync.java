/**
 * @class WeatherServiceSync
 * 
 * @brief This class uses synchronous AIDL interactions to query
 *        weather info via an Weather Web service.  The WeatherActivity
 *        that binds to this Service will receive an IBinder that's an
 *        instance of WeatherCall, which extends IBinder.  The
 *        Activity can then interact with this Service by making
 *        two-way method calls on the WeatherCall object asking this
 *        Service to lookup the weather of the location string.  After
 *        the lookup is finished, this Service sends the weather info
 *        results back to the Activity by returning a List of
 *        WeatherData.
 * 
 *        AIDL is an example of the Broker Pattern, in which all
 *        interprocess communication details are hidden behind the
 *        AIDL interfaces.
