/**
 * @class WeatherServiceAsync
 * 
 * @brief This class uses asynchronous AIDL interactions to query
 *        weather info via a Weather Web service.  The WeatherActivity
 *        that binds to this Service will receive an IBinder that's an
 *        instance of WeatherRequest, which extends IBinder.  The
 *        Activity can then interact with this Service by making
 *        one-way method calls on the WeatherRequest object asking
 *        this Service to lookup the weather, passing in a
 *        WeatherResults object and the location string.  After the
 *        lookup is finished, this Service sends the weather info results
 *        back to the Activity by calling sendResults() on the
 *        WeatherResults object.
 * 
 *        AIDL is an example of the Broker Pattern, in which all
 *        interprocess communication details are hidden behind the
 *        AIDL interfaces.
